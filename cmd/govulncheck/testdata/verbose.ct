GO-2021-0113
Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted language tag can cause Parse
to panic via an out of bounds read. If Parse is used to process untrusted user inputs,
this may be used as a vector for a denial of service attack.

Call stacks in your code:
    #1: for function Parse
        golang.org/vuln.main
            .../vuln.go:11:16
        golang.org/x/text/language.Parse


Found in:  golang.org/x/text/language@v0.3.0
Fixed in:  golang.org/x/text/language@v0.3.7
