Your code is affected by 2 vulnerabilities from 1 module.

Vulnerability #1: GO-2021-0113
  Due to improper index calculation, an incorrectly formatted
  language tag can cause Parse to panic via an out of bounds read.
  If Parse is used to process untrusted user inputs, this may be
  used as a vector for a denial of service attack.

  Module: golang.org/x/text
    Found in: golang.org/x/text@v0.3.0
    Fixed in: golang.org/x/text@v0.3.7

Vulnerability #2: GO-2020-0015
  An attacker could provide a single byte to a UTF16 decoder
  instantiated with UseBOM or ExpectBOM to trigger an infinite
  loop if the String function on the Decoder is called, or the
  Decoder is passed to transform.String. If used to parse user
  supplied input, this may be used as a denial of service vector.
